# Automatic Question Generation

This is my BE Computer Science final year project which aims at automatically generating questions from a given source of information such as a *wikipedia page link* , documents or books in *pdf,docx,doc* form by proper application of NLP and ML techniques. Choosing the language Python as my teammates for this project are familiar with the language.<br>

I have only little knowledge in the python or any kind of text processing or ML. I might be doing a lot of things wrong so please lend me a hand by letting me know how to do things better.
For example i know i might be structuring the project wrong as i plan to make it such that the user doesnt have to setup a lot before trying out the tool. 
Any Do(s) & Dont(s) or PRs are more than welcome. 

In the intial days i'll be using the README.md page as a indication of what i am upto rather than a more general introduction/summary of the project. 


#### Phase 1
- [x] Gather information from various sources convert them into simple *.txt* 
  - [ ] Save data into JSON for easy usage among files ahead (TBD if required)
- [ ] Simplify he complex and compund statements
- [ ] Study the *NLP parser* and simply the complex and compund statements
- [ ] *Named Entity Recognition* (NER) for the text files.
